# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Until this crate reaches 1.0, only the most recent release will be certainly be supported for
security updates, but an effort will be made to backport critical patches when possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, email [hi@jbr.me](mailto:hi@jbr.me).

Feel free to [draft a GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/jbr/routefinder/security/advisories/new) in addition to the above.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please do not _exclusively_ file a GitHub security advisory without also reaching out on another channel. GitHub's notifications for draft security advisories are inadequate and too easily missed.
